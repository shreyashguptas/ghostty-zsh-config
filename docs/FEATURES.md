- **Miniconda**: Lightweight Conda distribution
- **Python 3.12**: Latest Python version in dedicated environment
- **Auto-activation**: Python 3.12 environment activates automatically
- **Conda aliases**: Short commands for common operations

### Key Features

#### Environment Management
```bash
# List all environments
ce                      # Shows all conda environments

# Activate/deactivate environments
ca py312               # Activate Python 3.12 environment
cda                    # Deactivate current environment

# Create new environments
cc myproject python=3.11  # Create new environment with Python 3.11
cc data-science python=3.12 pandas numpy matplotlib  # Create with packages
```

#### Package Management
```bash
# Install packages
ci numpy               # Install numpy
ci pandas matplotlib   # Install multiple packages
ci -c conda-forge jupyter  # Install from specific channel

# Search packages
csp tensorflow         # Search for packages
csp "machine learning" # Search with keywords

# Update packages
cup numpy              # Update numpy
cup --all              # Update all packages in environment

# Remove packages
cr pandas              # Remove pandas
```

#### Python Environment
- **Default Python**: Python 3.12.11 is active by default
- **Package isolation**: Each environment has its own packages
- **Dependency management**: Conda handles complex dependencies automatically

### How to Test
```bash
# Check versions
python --version        # Should show Python 3.12.11
conda --version         # Should show Conda version

# List environments
ce                      # Should show py312 as active

# Test package installation
ci requests            # Install requests package
python -c "import requests; print('Success!')"  # Test import

# Create test environment
cc test-env python=3.11
ca test-env
python --version        # Should show Python 3.11
cda                    # Deactivate test environment
```

### Benefits
1. **Isolated environments**: Keep project dependencies separate
2. **Easy package management**: Install complex packages with one command
3. **Version control**: Use different Python versions for different projects
4. **Dependency resolution**: Conda automatically resolves package conflicts
5. **Cross-platform**: Same commands work on macOS, Linux, and Windows

### Common Workflows
